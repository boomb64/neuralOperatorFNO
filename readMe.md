This is the beginning of a markdown file for this git project.

I will update it more in the future.

All data comes from:
https://github.com/neuraloperator/Geo-FNO

The files can be downloaded from:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JUkPbx0-lgjFHPURH_kp1uqjfRn3aw9-

Once downloaded, they should be placed in 
```
data/naca
```

To view results of all models: 
Ensure that all models have been ran and are in the "models" folder.
Once this has been done, run the file allModelVisualization.py.
